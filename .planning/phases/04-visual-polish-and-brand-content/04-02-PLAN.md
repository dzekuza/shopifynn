<objective>
Create the About/Story page template using Shopify JSON template composition with existing sections.

Purpose: The Aurowe brand needs a dedicated About page that presents the craftsmanship narrative, artisan profiles, and Nordic manufacturing story in a luxury editorial layout — not a plain text page.

Output: New `templates/page.about.json` composing hero, image-with-text, multicolumn, rich-text, and stats-bar sections.

<tasks>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Create About/Story page JSON template</name>
  <files>templates/page.about.json</files>
  <action>
Read `templates/index.json` to understand the existing JSON template pattern used in this project (section keys, settings structure, block format).

Read these section schemas to understand available settings:
- `sections/hero.liquid` (schema block near end of file)
- `sections/image-with-text.liquid` (schema block)
- `sections/multicolumn.liquid` (schema block)
- `sections/rich-text.liquid` (schema block)
- `sections/stats-bar.liquid` (schema block)

Create `templates/page.about.json` with this editorial sequence:

1. **about-hero** (type: `hero`) — Page header with Aurowe story headline
   - Settings: subtitle "Our Story", heading "Forged in the Nordic Tradition", text with a brief brand philosophy line, heading_size "large", appropriate overlay_opacity for readability
   - Image will be set by merchant in theme editor (leave image setting empty or use a sensible default if the hero section requires one)

2. **story-narrative** (type: `image-with-text`) — The craftsmanship story
   - Settings: subtitle "The Craft", heading "Built by Hand, Built to Last", text describing the Aurowe manufacturing philosophy (2-3 sentences about thermowood craftsmanship, Nordic heritage, and quality commitment), layout "image_left"
   - Image set by merchant in editor

3. **manufacturing-story** (type: `image-with-text`) — Nordic manufacturing narrative
   - Settings: subtitle "Nordic Manufacturing", heading "Where Nature Meets Precision", text about the manufacturing process in Nordic region (sustainable timber, modern engineering, traditional craft), layout "image_right" (alternating from previous)

4. **artisan-profiles** (type: `multicolumn`) — The artisans section
   - Settings: heading "The Artisans Behind Aurowe", columns appropriate for the section (check schema for options — likely 3), image_ratio setting if available (use "circle" for portrait photos)
   - Blocks: Create 3 artisan blocks, each with:
     - heading: Placeholder artisan name (e.g., "Lars Eriksson", "Ingrid Johansson", "Erik Lindqvist")
     - text: Placeholder role and expertise description (e.g., "Master craftsman with 20 years of thermowood expertise")
     - image: Leave empty (merchant uploads in theme editor)
   - Use the block type from the multicolumn schema (read it to get the exact block type name)

5. **heritage-numbers** (type: `stats-bar`) — Heritage statistics
   - Read stats-bar.liquid schema to understand the block structure
   - Blocks: Create 3-4 stat blocks with Nordic heritage numbers, e.g.:
     - "25+" / "Years of Craftsmanship"
     - "10,000+" / "Tubs Delivered"
     - "100%" / "Sustainably Sourced Timber"
     - "Nordic" / "Manufacturing Heritage"
   - Use exact block type and setting IDs from the schema

6. **footer-cta** (type: `rich-text`) — Closing call to action
   - Settings: heading "Experience the Aurowe Difference", text inviting visitors to explore the configurator or contact the team

Include an `"order"` array listing all section keys in the correct editorial sequence.

**CRITICAL:** Do NOT include a `main-page` section. The `main-page` section renders `{{ page.content }}` as plain rich text — this is explicitly prohibited by BRAND-03. The entire page content comes from the composed sections.

Match the JSON formatting style used in `templates/index.json` (indentation, key quoting, etc.).

Read `templates/page.about.json` and confirm:
1. File is valid JSON (no syntax errors)
2. Contains sections: about-hero, story-narrative, manufacturing-story, artisan-profiles, heritage-numbers, footer-cta
3. Does NOT contain a "main-page" section type
4. The "order" array lists all section keys
5. Artisan profiles use the multicolumn section type with 3 blocks
6. Each section's settings use valid setting IDs from the section schema

  <done>About/Story page template exists at `templates/page.about.json` composing hero, image-with-text (x2), multicolumn, stats-bar, and rich-text sections in an editorial sequence. No main-page section is included.</done>

<task type="checkpoint:human-verify" gate="blocking">
  <name>Task 2: Verify About page template in theme editor</name>
  <files>templates/page.about.json</files>
  <action>
Run `shopify theme dev` and verify the About page template renders correctly. This is a human verification checkpoint.

What was built: About/Story page JSON template (`templates/page.about.json`) composing existing sections into an editorial layout: hero header, two image-with-text story sections, artisan profiles grid, heritage statistics, and a closing CTA.

How to verify:
1. Run `shopify theme dev` and open the local preview URL
2. In Shopify admin (or theme editor), create a new Page with handle "about" and assign the template "page.about"
3. Open the page in the theme editor — verify all 6 sections appear in order
4. Confirm the layout is editorial (hero + alternating image-text + grid + stats + CTA), NOT a plain text page
5. Verify artisan profiles section shows 3 columns with placeholder text (images to be added by merchant)
6. Verify the page looks like a luxury brand About page, not a default content page

Note: After committing `templates/page.about.json`, a Page must be created in Shopify admin with the "page.about" template assigned. `shopify theme push` uploads the template but does not create the Page automatically.

Resume signal: Type "approved" or describe layout/content issues to fix.
