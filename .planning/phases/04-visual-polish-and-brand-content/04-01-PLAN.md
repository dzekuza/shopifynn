<objective>
Elevate hero, features, and testimonials sections to luxury tier with refined CSS and consistent GSAP animations.

Purpose: The storefront sections need visual polish to match the Aurowe luxury Nordic brand positioning. The testimonials section has a CSS bug preventing avatars from displaying properly. Animation timing varies inconsistently across sections.

Output: Updated `assets/theme.css` with hero/features/testimonials refinements and avatar fix. Updated `assets/theme.js` with standardized GSAP parameters.

<tasks>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Refine hero, features, and testimonials CSS and fix avatar layout</name>
  <files>assets/theme.css</files>
  <action>
Read `assets/theme.css` fully. Locate the hero CSS section (around lines 610-699), features CSS section (around lines 930-990), and testimonials CSS section. Make the following changes:

**Hero section (VIS-01):**
- Add `letter-spacing: 0.04em` to `.hero__heading` for luxury typography feel
- Refine `.hero__heading` line-height to `1.1` (tighter for large display headings)
- Add `letter-spacing: 0.12em; text-transform: uppercase` to `.hero__subtitle` for subtitle tracking
- Increase `.hero__content` vertical padding for more breathing room (aim for `padding: 80px 0` on desktop)
- Add a subtle `.hero__scroll-indicator` style if the hero template renders one (check hero.liquid first)

**Features section (VIS-02):**
- Increase card padding to `padding: 40px 32px` for more spacious feel
- Add `transition: transform 0.3s ease, box-shadow 0.3s ease` and `hover: transform: translateY(-4px); box-shadow: 0 8px 24px rgba(0,0,0,0.08)` to feature cards
- Ensure icon containers have consistent sizing (e.g., `width: 56px; height: 56px; display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center`)
- Set heading weight to `font-weight: 600` for stronger visual hierarchy

**Testimonials section (VIS-03):**
- Fix `.testimonials__author` from `flex-direction: column` to `flex-direction: row; align-items: center; gap: 12px`
- Add `.testimonials__avatar { width: 40px; height: 40px; border-radius: 50%; object-fit: cover; flex-shrink: 0; }`
- Verify the star rating elements have adequate styling (the Liquid template already renders stars)

**Typography consistency (VIS-04):**
- Audit `letter-spacing` across section headings — standardize to `0.02em` for `.section__heading` base and `0.04em` for large hero-style headings
- Standardize `margin-bottom` on `.section__subtitle` to `16px` across all sections
- Do NOT use `!important` — avoid fighting inline styles from Liquid conditionals. Focus on properties not overridden inline: `letter-spacing`, `line-height`, `font-weight`, `color`, `margin-bottom`

Maintain the existing CSS section comment banner organization. Add new rules within the relevant section blocks, not scattered.
  </action>
  <verify>
Read the modified `assets/theme.css` and confirm:
1. `.testimonials__avatar` class exists with width/height/border-radius
2. `.testimonials__author` has `flex-direction: row`
3. Hero heading has `letter-spacing` property
4. Feature cards have hover transition
5. No `!important` declarations were added
  </verify>
  <done>Hero typography is refined with letter-spacing and tighter line-height. Features cards have hover lift effect and spacious padding. Testimonials avatar displays as 40x40 circle next to author name. Section heading typography is consistent.</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Standardize GSAP animation parameters across sections</name>
  <files>assets/theme.js</files>
  <action>
Read `assets/theme.js` fully. Locate the `initGSAPAnimations()` function (around line 580+). Audit all `gsap.from()` and `gsap.to()` calls. Standardize timing parameters to these values (derived from research audit of existing code):

**Standard animation vocabulary (add as a comment block above initGSAPAnimations):**
```
/* --- GSAP Animation Standards ---
 * Hero entry:      duration: 0.9, stagger: 0.12, ease: 'power3.out', delay: 0.3
 * Section headers: duration: 0.8, y: 32, ease: 'power3.out'
 * Card stagger:    duration: 0.7, y: 40, stagger: 0.10, ease: 'power3.out'
 * Side-slide:      duration: 0.8, x: +/-40, ease: 'power3.out'
 * --- */
```

**Changes:**
- Hero animation: change `stagger: 0.15` to `stagger: 0.12` for snappier feel
- Ensure all section scroll animations use `ease: 'power3.out'` consistently (audit each call)
- Ensure card stagger animations use `stagger: 0.10` consistently
- Ensure all y-offset values are in the 30-40 range (no outliers like y: 60 or y: 15)
- Do NOT change the GSAP load guard (`if (typeof gsap !== 'undefined')`) — Phase 3 PERF-03 owns that

Keep the existing code structure. Only modify animation parameter values and add the standards comment block.
  </action>
  <verify>
Read the modified `assets/theme.js` and confirm:
1. Comment block with animation standards exists above `initGSAPAnimations`
2. Hero stagger is 0.12
3. All `ease` values are `'power3.out'`
4. No changes to the GSAP load guard
5. y-offset values are within 30-40 range
  </verify>
  <done>All GSAP animations use consistent duration, ease, stagger, and y-offset values. A comment block documents the standard animation vocabulary for future maintainers.</done>
</task>

<task type="checkpoint:human-verify" gate="blocking">
  <name>Task 3: Visual verification of section polish</name>
  <files>assets/theme.css, assets/theme.js</files>
  <action>
Run `shopify theme dev` and visually verify all CSS and animation changes. This is a human verification checkpoint — present the running theme for review.

What was built: Refined CSS for hero (typography, spacing), features (card hover, padding), testimonials (avatar layout fix, star ratings), and standardized GSAP animation timing across all sections.

How to verify:
1. Run `shopify theme dev` and open the local preview URL
2. Hero section: Verify heading has refined letter-spacing, subtitle has uppercase tracking, content has generous vertical padding. Watch the entry animation — elements should stagger in smoothly.
3. Features section: Hover over feature cards — they should lift with a subtle shadow. Cards should have spacious padding. Icons should be consistently sized.
4. Testimonials section: If avatar images are uploaded in the theme editor, they should appear as 40x40 circles to the left of the author name (not stacked vertically). Star ratings should be visible.
5. Cross-section consistency: Scroll through the full homepage — animation timing should feel cohesive (no section animating noticeably faster or slower than others).

Resume signal: Type "approved" or describe visual issues to fix.

- Testimonials avatars render as circles beside author name
- GSAP animations feel cohesive across all sections
- No regressions to existing functionality
